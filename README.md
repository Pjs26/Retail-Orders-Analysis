 ## **Retail Orders Analysis**
Retail Order Analysis is revolutionizing the way retail stores operate, leading to higher efficiency and better results overall. Although retail stores have been using analytics for years, the collection, processing, and analysis of data have predominantly been manual. Given the nature of retail store dynamics, this manual approach has constrained retailers.

This project provides an opportunity to explore predictive analytics in the Retail Orders.


#### **Problem Statement:**
Retail stores aim to expand their business by reducing manufacturing costs and increasing sales percentages, which benefits both customers and businesses. Customers will enjoy consistent product availability without shortages. 

This project focuses on studying customer behaviour and evaluating marketing trends, among other aspects. By analysing data from sources such as customer purchase histories, products, and point-of-sale systems, retailers can gain valuable insights into customer habits and preferences. 
Ultimately, data analytics helps retailers boost sales, cut costs, and improve customer satisfaction and loyalty.


#### **Questions to Address:**
1.	Find the top 10 highest revenue generating products
2.	Find the top 5 highest selling products in each region
3.	Find the month over growth comparison for 2022 and 2023
4.	For each category which month has the highest sales
5.	Which sub-category had highest growth by profit in 2023 compared to 2022


**Task 1:** Download the Retail Orders Dataset using the Kaggle API in a Jupyter notebook.

**Task 2:** Clean and process the data.

**Task 3:** Load the cleaned dataset into Microsoft SQL Server.

**Task 4:** Analyze the cleaned data using SQL Server.


#### **Additional Notes**
•	Make sure the necessary packages and libraries are installed before running the code.

•	Document your code and analyse effectively.

•	Maintain a logical and organized structure within your codebase.
